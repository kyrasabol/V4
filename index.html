            The society we live in today revolves around cheap, easy, and fast. With those three values
            in mind, the decisions and actions humans have made have costed the environment so much.

            <h3>What does it mean to live an eco-friendly lifestyle?</h3> 
            Many people today are aware of the large enviornmental issues caused by humans 
            that afflict our planet, and make an effort to adopt
            a lifestyle that minimizes their individual impact (Environment Blog). This website strives
            to share the easiest ways to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. 
          
            <h3>Why would someone want to live an eco-friendly lifestyle?</h3>
            There are many benefits to striving to live more environmentally friendly. For example, it can
            be more cost efficent, build a better community, promote a healthier lifestyle, and help raise awareness
            for future generations to come (Campbell).
