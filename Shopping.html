    <h2> Shopping for New Clothes</h2>
    <p> Can you be more environmentally friendly when shopping for clothes? Short answer, absolutely! Here are some ideas that
        I use almost everytime I am looking for something new. 
        
        <h3>Do Your Research</h3> 
        When choosing from a new company to shop at, browse the company website. Oftentimes, these websites will have 'About' sections with links
        connecting you to information. Find out the history of the company, such as who started it and who owned it. Look for sections entitled 'Sustainability'. 
        These types of sections will often break down policies and standards they hold when being environmentally friendly. Brands with labels and certifications
        such as 'USD Orangic', 'Global Organic Textile Standard' or 'Fair Trade Certified' demonstrate a brand is interested in ethical and 
        sustianable methods. 
        
        <h3>Shop Secondhand</h3> 
        Sometimes the best finds are right in your local thrift shop! Not only will you spend less, but you help reduce the demand for new clothes (Dandy in the Bronx).
        If you're still hesitant about shopping secondhand, <a href="https://www.upcyclethat.com/how-to-thrift-shop/">here are some tips</a> on how to get started. <br />
        
        <h3>Go Natural</h3> 
        Clothing items made from natural materials like cotton, silk, wool, or linen are biodegradable! Stay clear from clothing made with polyester, nylon, or rayon, 
        just to name a few. Clothing made from these materials are plastic-based. Polyester, for example, is a kind of plastic made from petroleum, which is a 
        non-renewable source. On the other hand, shopping for clothing made out of linen is good for both 
        <a href="https://stilwellmemorial.com/sleeping/9-surprising-health-and-wellness-benefits-of-linen/">the body</a> and for the environment!
