            <h3>V1 (Week of: April 18-24) </h3>
            This week I created the home page for my site. This included adding my navigation, adding sections such as my introduction,
            the tips section, and the about me section. I also created a basic style sheet for my home page. The CSS render the page in the font I wanted,
            created colored boxes to seperate my sections, and made the hyperlinks to internal and external sources much more aesthetically pleasing. In the
            future, I do think I will rearrange some of the CSS organization I have going on to make it easier to search and to apply rules. This first draft
            is a little scattered. I later hope to switch the "About Me" section into a side column and add a personal photo. I also might mess around with 
            the look of the "Ready" section. The pages with "Under Construction" will see some added content over the next few weeks. 
        </p>

        <p> 
           <h3> V2 (Week of: May 2-7) </h3>
            This week I created the shopping pages and the recycle page. On the home page, I added a box shadow for my ready section.
            The shopping pages featured use of floats and background images. The recycle page featured use of borders, grids, and gradients.
            Formatting the grid was the most difficult part, but it actually looks really nice. I don't care for the gradient or the borders,
            so that won't be a part of the next version. I'm not 100% comfortable with using a grid yet, so I haven't decided if my following
            versions will feature a grid. We'll see! 
        </p>

        <p> 
           <h3> V3 (Week of: May 16-22) </h3>
            This week I created a table for my DIY page. Instead of one long page with different sections of items, I used the table in order
            to create a sense of uformity and quick access. I also created a media CSS file to reformat the table for mobile readers. However,
            there is an issue with the formatting which I will need to work on in the future. I enjoyed creating the table. It was very 
            easy to follow and made the page look really good! 
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3> V4 (Week of June 6-13)</h3>
            This week I completely redid the wireframe, layout, and styles of my site. I used all that I learned from the previous weeks to create
            a more simplifed code, and redid my color palette. I uniformed all my pages to one wireframe - with the exception of the DIY table. I also 
            had been using floated layouts, but I really liked the idea of a flex layout. I redid all my pages with a flexible layout. I also decided
            to redo my color palette for a more garden-type look. I really like the look of the brown, green, and red/orange together. Overall, I really
            enjoyed the redeisgn because I could put to work all the things I have learned during this course.

            Hi, my name is Kyra. I love the planet Earth, and I am lazy. I had gotten used to the three values of 
            cheap, easy, and fast, but the more I learned about how my actions can have an affect on other people
            and our environment, I wanted to make some changes. It was hard (and still is!) to make changes, but 
            the more gradually I do so, the better I feel about myself. I want to help others incorporate eco-friendly 
            habits into their lifestyle with the idea that eco-friendly can be cheaper, easier, and faster than they think.
